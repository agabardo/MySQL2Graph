# MySQL2Graph
Java project to import data from MySQL and generate a graph in the format .NET (Pajek).<br/>
You can do the exact same thing with Gephi File -> Import Database -> Edge List.<br/>
This is a personal tiny project to automate the reading from MySQL and parsing as a .NET graph.<br/>
Feel free to use, just remember to write your own queries and adjust the database connection.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
