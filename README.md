# MySQL2Graph
Java project to import data from MySQL and generate a graph in the format .NET (Pajek).
You can do the exact same thing with Gephi File -> Import Database -> Edge List.
This is a personal tiny project to automate the reading from MySQL and parsing as a .NET graph.
Feel free to use, just remember to write your own queries and adjust the database connection.

Cheer's,
Ademir
